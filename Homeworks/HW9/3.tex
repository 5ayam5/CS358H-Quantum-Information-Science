\begin{solution}[label=ques:3a]
  \begin{question}
    Confirm that our intelligence is correct by using $N$ and $\varphi(N)$ to determine the two factors $p$ and $q$ of $N$ and checking that indeed $pq = N$. (Note that part (a) is not required in the parts that follow.)
  \end{question}
  \tcblower{}
  \begin{proof}
    We will use the solution from Question~\ref{ques:4} to solve for $p, q$. On solving, we get:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        p &= 2237\\
        q &= 2087\\
        pq &= 2237 \times 2087 = 4668619 = N
      \end{split}
      \label{eq:pq}
    \end{equation}
  \end{proof}
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[label=ques:3b]
  \begin{question}
    Meanwhile an analyst has gone ahead and done the work of determining 
\[
d = 3109531
\]
to be the inverse of $e$ in the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Z}_{\varphi(N)}^\times$. Verify that this is correct.
  \end{question}
  \tcblower{}
  \begin{proof}
    If $d$ is computed correctly, we must have $e\cdot d = 1 \bmod \varphi(N)$. On solving this, we get $e\cdot d = 9328593$, which on dividing with $\varphi(N)$ gives $1$ as a remainder.
  \end{proof}
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[label=ques:3c]
  \begin{question}
    Decrypt the given message.
  \end{question}
  \tcblower{}
  \begin{proof}[Solution]
    To decrypt the message, we need to compute $m_0 = m^d \bmod N$. On solving we get $m_0 = 548077$, which gives us the message as ``6PM".
  \end{proof}
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[label=ques:3d]
  \begin{question}
    Encrypt a new message in the same format instructing to meet an hour later; we will send this to the second spy instead of the original message.
  \end{question}
  \tcblower{}
  \begin{proof}[Solution]
    We wish to encrypt the message ``7PM", this can be written in the decimal encoding as $m_1 = 558077$. The encrypted message will be $m_1^e \bmod N = 3706174$.
  \end{proof}
\end{solution}
