  \begin{question}
  Which of the following views about quantum mechanics necessarily
  lead to experimental predictions that are \emph{different} from the
  predictions of conventional QM? 
  Make two distinct lists: one list of the views that do, and one list of the views that don't.
  (Note: For this question, we're only interested in clear-cut predictions about the observed behaviors of ``dumb physical systems'' like masses or entangled particles, not about the experiences of conscious observers like Wigner's friend.  Beyond that, though, we don't care how easy or hard the prediction is to test in practice.)
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item The Many-Worlds Interpretation
    
    \item The Copenhagen Interpretation
    
    \item GRW (Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber) dynamical collapse
    
    \item Penrose's gravity-induced quantum state collapse
    
    \item Local hidden variables
    
    \item Nonlocal hidden variables (including Bohmian mechanics)
  \end{enumerate}
  \end{question}

  \begin{proof}[Solution]
    $ $
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Views that lead to different predictions:}
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item GRW (Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber) dynamical collapse -- an experiment on a system larger than a probability $p$ of collapse for each individual particle, then this theory will have a different outcome on that system from conventional QM (we have been able to construct dobule slit experiments on larger and larger particles, like the buckyball)
          \item Penrose's gravity-induced quantum state collapse -- similar to GRW, an experiment for a large enough system, separated by a large enough distance, will have a different outcome than conventional QM (and experiments have been heading in this direction with long-distance teleportation that has been shown)
          \item Local hidden variables -- this has been proven false by experiments that disobey the Bell inequality
        \end{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Views that don't lead to different predictions:}
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item The Many-Worlds Interpretation -- this agrees with predictions of conventional QM, albeit not at a philosophical level
          \item The Copenhagen Interpretation -- this agrees with predictions of conventional QM since it just says that it is a result of calculations
          \item Nonlocal hidden variables (including Bohmian mechanics) -- this agrees with predictions of conventional QM, but requires someone to ``monitor" all particles with faster-than-light communication
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{proof}
